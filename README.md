# Game of Fives!
## Code Institute's Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Front-End

*Hero image goes here*

Game of Fives is an online game of chance that has players assessing the odds against the computer in order to win points and measure their success over multiple plays. Based loosely on the real life drinking game, players take turns guessing the correct total in a given round from multiples of five. This total changes depending on what the player and computer choose to display out of zero (a balled up fist) or five (an open palm), with points awarded when the guess is correct. My aim with this project is to create a fun and memorable game that captures the essence of the loud, rowdy drinking game while being an enjoyable means of procrastination online.

This project is the second of four ‘milestone’ projects which are required to complete the Code Institute’s diploma in full stack web development. Assessment criteria for this milestone project focuses on the ability to produce an interactive front-end site that responds to users’ actions and inputs using previously learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript.
