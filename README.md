# Game of Fives!
## Code Institute's Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Front-End

*Hero image goes here*

Game of Fives is an online game of chance that has players assessing the odds against the computer in order to win points and measure their success over multiple plays. Based loosely on the real life drinking game, players take turns guessing the correct total in a given round from multiples of five. This total changes depending on what the player and computer choose to display out of zero (a balled up fist) or five (an open palm), with points awarded when the guess is correct. My aim with this project is to create a fun and memorable game that captures the essence of the loud, rowdy drinking game while being an enjoyable means of procrastination online.

This project is the second of four ‘milestone’ projects which are required to complete the Code Institute’s diploma in full stack web development. Assessment criteria for this milestone project focuses on the ability to produce an interactive front-end site that responds to users’ actions and inputs using previously learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## UX

My main goals for the creation of this website were as follows:
* Create a fun game that is enjoyable to play and functions completely as intended.
* Create a game that produces a positive user response from both its gameplay and general aesthetics.
* Demonstrate my new found competence in applying Javascript and jQuery to independently coded projects (alongside previously learnt HTML and CSS) so as to meet the pass criteria of the Code Institute for this milestone project.

### User Stories

#### Project Stakeholder

As the owner of the site:

1. I want the site to function properly and as intended so that I can pass this part of the course.
2. I want the site to be eye-catching to look at so that users are left with a positive emotional response and return to the site.
3. I want users to enjoy the game so that they might recommend it to other people and come back to play more.

#### Users

As a player:

1. I want to enjoy playing the game so that I can justify procrastinating in this way.
2. I want to be able to navigate the site intuitively to find the start button or instructions.
3. I want instructions that explain how to play the game if I don’t know already so that I can learn quickly how to get started.
4. I want the game to provide feedback to me during play so that I know when it’s my go, whether I’ve chosen correctly or incorrectly, and what my current score is vs the computer.
5. I want to choose the level of difficulty to play on so I can test myself on harder difficulties.
6. I want my wins and losses to be recorded so that when I return to the site I can see historically how successful I am at this game.
7. I want the game to load quickly and respond properly to my interactions as I expect them to.

## Planning and Design

### Strategy Plane

The **user stories** as detailed in the previous section was the first part of the development process and was very helpful in deciding which features were critical to the success of the site. Features that I did not deem necessary to myself (as the stakeholder) and the players reaching the end of their journeys would not be considered.

The **focus** of the project is:
* To create a fun interactive game based off of the drinking game ‘fives’.

The **business goal** for the stakeholder:
* Have a site that encourages players to return.

*To meet the focus and business goal, I therefore needed to create a bespoke website using HTML, CSS and Javascript to enable me to introduce the necessary functionality to produce a game.* **(work on this bit)**

While strategising for this particular project, I figured that a good place to start for inspiration on layout and features would be to look up some popular online versions of the rock, paper scissors as this game mirrors several aspects of 'Fives'. With this in mind, I found the following sites very useful to begin with:

* [Afiniti - Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://www.afiniti.com/corporate/rock-paper-scissors)
* [Online Stopwatch - Rock Paper Scissors!](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/chance-games/rock-paper-scissors/)

Using the below importance vs viability metric, I was able to list out the opportunities on offer when creating the game and decide which ones were achievable, relevant and appropriate with regard to my user stories.

| Opportunity | Importance	 | Viability 
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------
| Game vs 1 computer player | 5 | 5
| Option to increase difficulty | 3 | 4
| Explanation of the rules | 4 | 5
| Record wins vs losses record | 3 | 4
| Sound effects | 3 | 3
| Mute option | 5 | 3
| Option to play against a human player | 2 | 1
| **Total** | 25 | 25

 From this reserach, I concluded that the features I wanted to implement into Game of Fives were mostly viable when compared to their necessity in this project. However, it became clear early on that I would not be able to add functionality allowing players to compete against other human players. While this would have been a really exciting prospect, it would have likely been beyond my current coding capabilities and comparitively not as important for the completion of my user journeys.

 ### Scope Plane

Based on information I uncovered during the strategy plane, and considering any limitations of my current coding abilities, the features I decided were critical to include are as follows:

#### Required functional specifications
* Choice of difficulty setting
* Explanation of the rules
* Element of competition against another 'player'
* Visible manifestation of current scores
* Visible manifestation of historic wins vs losses record
* A means of ending the game so that there is a victor

#### Content requirements of these features
* Game must load quickly


#### Nice to haves
* Sound effects
* Background music during gameplay
* Section that explains the real life drinking game rules
